DB seeding
    “WealthTracker – SQLite seed data & mobile testing”

    Here is my DB schema (or summary).
    I want realistic seed data for testing on mobile.
    Add dev-only seed flag

    Make seed idempotent

    Insert:

    Categories

    Assets

    Transactions

    Snapshot data

    So your app opens with realistic data immediately.

    create seed data for all categories - realestate, stocks, gold, bank deposits, retirement funds, loans etc..
